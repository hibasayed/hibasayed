          As of July 2020, there are more than 24 million people in Yemen in need of humanitarian assistance. The UN's Humanitarian Response Plan has a $2 billion dollar deficit, but we can help bring it down to $0.

        The Situation in Yemen
      </h2>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        More than 20.5 million people lack access to clean water and sanitation. This increases the risk of  disease, which is alarming due to Yemen recently had a cholera epidemic and most not taking COVID-19 warnings seriously.
        As COVID‑19 spreads through communities in Yemen, funding shortfalls are taking an enormous toll on delivering life-saving access to clean water and soap. This puts millions at an extreme risk of contracting disease and losing an essential resource for survival.
        The situation is so disastrous that, in 2017, the United Nations said a child under the age of five was dying every 10 minutes from preventable causes, including hunger, disease and violence.

        The Famine

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
      Yemen imports 90 percent of its food supply, however due to the conflict, many of Yemen's sea ports have been closed, and goods can’t get in easily.
      Due to the central bank and many companies in Yemen being closed, the currency value free falling, and rampant inflation what little food is avaliable is priced at rates that many cannot afford.  
      Despite mounting economic and health pressures on Yemen, the world’s largest aid response is scaling back due to insufficient funding.
      The WFP in April already halved food aid to alternate months in north Yemen, and by the end of August Nutrition services for 2.5 million children could cease.

        The Cause
      </h2>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
      Yemen had been vulnerable before the current conflict, around half the population lived below the poverty line, and the country faced chronic instability, weak governance, underdevelopment, unemployment and hunger.
      In late 2014, Yemin's president, Abdrabbuh Hadi, struggled to fix the country's problems, including corruption, unemployment and food insecurity. It was during this time that an armed group, the Houthis, moved into the capital city, Sana’a, and took over government institutions. Hadi and other senior government officials fled Yemen after the takeover.
      Shortly after, a coalition of a dozen states, led by Saudi Arabia, launched a military campaign to take back Houthi-held areas and restore power to Hadi’s government. 
      Unfortunately the conflict continues this day and many residing in Yemen are living in terrible conditions and need humanitarian aid.

        The Importance
      </h2>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
      Despite humanitarian aid, over 20 million Yemenis are food insecure, of which nearly 10 million are acutely food insecure.
      Yemen's rate of child malnutrition is one of the highest in the world and the nutrition situation continues to deteriorate. A recent survey showed that almost one third of families have gaps in their diets, and hardly ever consume foods like pulses, vegetables, fruit, dairy products or meat. Additonally, malnutrition rates among women and children in Yemen remain among the highest in the world, with more than a million women and 2 million children requiring treatment for acute malnutrition.
      This is concerning because malnutrition has long-lasting physiologic effects, including an increased susceptibility to fat accumulation, lower fat oxidation, and a reduced capacity for manual work, among other impairments. Undernutrition in children has also been linked to poor mental development and school achievement as well as behavioural abnormalities. What's worse is that some of these effects seem to be epigenetic, passing on to the next generation.
      To save the current and future generation we must act fast to stop the famine in Yemen. Please go to the <a hrep="https://yemen-crisis.glitch.me/take-action.html"> take action tab</a> to find ways you can help those in Yemen!
